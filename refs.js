Due to the ongoing bombardment, the UN is currently relying on numbers provided by the Gaza Ministry of Health. UN officials see no reason to doubt the figures, which have not been inflated in the past, and which recent studies demonstrate are not now being inflated, see e.g., Adam Tayor, “More than 20,000 dead in Gaza, a historic human toll”, Washington Post (22 December 2023), https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/22/gaza-israel-war-20000-dead/; and Benjamin Q Hunyh, Elizabeth T Chin, Paul B Spiegel, “No evidence of inflated mortality reporting from the Gaza Ministry of Health”, The Lancet (6 December 2023), https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02713-7/fulltext. There may in fact be underreporting, as those whose bodies are not brought to a hospital or morgue are not routinely included in the casualty numbers. In circumstances where so many hospitals have ceased functioning, where Palestinians are unable to reach them — and indeed, as there are repeated reports of people having to resort to burying bodies on the street where they find them, the underreporting could be significant. At present, approximately 7,780 people are missing, presumed dead, but not yet included in the official statistics, Zeina Jamaluddine, Francesco Checchi, Oona M R Campbell, “Excess mortality in Gaza: 7-26, 2023”, The Lancet (26 November 2023), https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02640-5/fulltext.",
